This project has solutions... to some problems. Did you ask for solutions to these problems? 

"No questions, no answers"

Ok, mystery aside. these are solutions to some problems for foobar.

1_1's solution is intended to take an array of numbers and a number representing frequency, EX: ( theFunct([2,3,1,2,2,1], 2) ) and output an array that maintains original order of numbers in the array that match number of frequency. IE ( [3,1,1] ).

2_2's solution is FAST! The idea is to allow the user to submit an array of numbers and pull the largest possible number from that array that is divisible by 3.
